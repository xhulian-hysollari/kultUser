        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>We are beauty curators, rather than selling full beauty lines weâ€™ve cherry-picked only the kult products.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kult was founded with a thirst for transparency and products that deliver. Tired of having bathroom cabinets cluttered
          with half-empty or untouched bottles, it was high time for a change in the way we approached beauty. We pooled
          our resources with our expert panel to create a site that embodies our wish list of products, features an uncluttered
          design, complete with global bestsellers and insider beauty secrets.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our mission is to demystify the beauty industry, combining consumer trials with the vast knowledge of our expert
          panel to filter out the blaggers and braggers from the gems that do what they say on the tin. The result is a beauty
          hall of fame you can shop in the knowledge that anything you buy will be outstanding.</p>
