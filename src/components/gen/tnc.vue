        <ol class="tc_main">
          <li>
            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p>Welcome to www.kult.in. Please read these terms of service (“
              <strong>Terms of Service</strong>” or “
              <strong>Agreement</strong>“) carefully as they contain the legal terms and conditions that you agree to when you use
              the service provided by us through Kult.in (“Site”).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Membership:</h4>
            <p>Kult.in membership is available through registration process after you submit certain requested information to
              Kult.in. By registration you don’t agree to our Terms of Service.</p>
          </li>
          <p>Please be aware that a member of Kult.in is not allowed to run any paid ads on Google, Facebook or any other platform
            pointing to Kult.in. If the member does not comply with this then it would result in immediate termination of
            his/her account.</p>
          <li>
            <h4>Our Service:</h4>
            <h5>CASHBACK SERVICE:</h5>
            <p>Our Cashback Service allows users who register on the Site (“
              <strong>Members</strong>“) and therefore create an account with us (“
              <strong>Account</strong>“) to earn cashback on tracked purchases from retailers on the Site (“
              <strong>Retailers</strong>“). To qualify for cashback, the Retailer must confirm that the Member’s purchase is tracked,
              genuine and successful (constituting a “
              <strong>Qualifying Transaction</strong>“), and your resulting cashback must be received by us (becoming “
              <strong>Cashback</strong>” as a result).</p>
            <p>
              In the event that the Retailers do no track a transaction using their affiliate tracking system, then such sales might not
              be paid to Kult, and hence any due or expected cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the Member.
            </p>
            <h5>
              UNIQUE REFERRAL FEE:

              The Kult.in Service also provides a unique and ingenious referral fees to its Members where the Members get SIZTY per cent

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Becoming a Member</h4>
            <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to become a Member.</p>
            <p>You must register for the Cashback Service using accurate and current information about yourself – including
              your correct name, address and any other requested details. If you are asked for, and provide, details of a
              bank account or Cheque payment details into which you wish to receive payments (your “Cashback Receipt Method”),
              you (a) must ensure that you are, and remain, fully entitled to use that Cashback Receipt Method, and (b) confirm
              that you wish to receive cashback through that Cashback Receipt Method. You should keep this information updated
              through your Account.</p>
            <p>Note that your Cashback Receipt Method (such as NEFT or Cheque) may have rules about the maximum or minimum payment
              that you can receive through that Cashback Receipt Method.</p>
            <p>Important: You must ensure that the email address we hold for you is kept up-to-date and that you have full access
              to it – we will be sending you important messages there. If you change email address, then you must change
              the address we hold for you on your Account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cashback and Referral Fees:</h4>
            <p>After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction, and once we have received the resulting Cashback
              for that Qualifying Transaction, we pass that Cashback to the Member through his/her Cashback Receipt Method.</p>
            <p>Please note that there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a Retailer may not constitute a
              Qualifying Transaction, or Cashback may not result from it. This is also true for a Qualifying Referral. The
              Member understands that all transactions made by him/her are not with us, but with the individual Retailer.
              Further, from time to time Retailers may increase or decrease the commission paid – in which case the cashback
              offer illustrated on our Site may be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions will be credited in
              line with the commission reported to us by the Retailer, which may be more or less than the advertised rate.
              We shall not be liable for any difference in the expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback received
              by the Member.</p>
            <p>When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will credit your Account with an ‘unconfirmed
              cashback’. Once the Retailer confirms the transaction, the payment will be marked as ‘Confirmed’ – this can
              take 600 days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned or the sale reversed or amended
              by any means then the cashback payment will not be made. Apart from the Retailer, it is also mandatory for
              the members to intimate Kult about any returns or exchanges for which they might have earned cashback unduly.</p>
            <p>Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction (including cashback through a Qualifying
              Referral) shall be at the sole discretion of the Retailer or us and the Member understands and agrees to the
              same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to report a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction
              as Qualifying Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in the event due to some technical or other
              error we cannot trace a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction as a Qualifying Transaction
              or a Qualifying Referral for any reason whatsoever. Whilst we will endeavour to recuperate non-payments from
              the Retailer, the decision of ourselves, the Retailer or Retailer’s tracking agent is final. Whilst we will
              try and recuperate missing commissions, at any point we reserve the right not to chase missing commission claims,
              particularly where no purchase has been made.</p>

            <p>Cash Back is not fixed and paid out if the User:</p>
            <p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Leared the KULT website cookie manually or automatically with computer browser settings; in the settings
                of User computer’s browser set prohibition to save (receive) cookies and / or cookies from KULT website;</li>
              <li>Installed a new version of the browser on its computer, resulting in the deletion of the Users individual
                settings, including the internet cookies, and made an order;
              </li>
              <li>
                Browsers have installed extensions and / or settings that block an advertisement, such as AdBlock, etc.;
              </li>
              <li>Until the moment of purchase / order switched to the homepage of the Partner from another internet resource
                links / or another transfer point (banner, ad, e-mail, etc.);</li>
              <li>Before or during the order, additional discounts or offers from Partners that are not compatible with the
                KULT;
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Further, in the event that the Retailer feels that the purchase is not genuine for any reason whatsoever and
              we do not receive any Cashback for the transaction, the Member will not receive any Cashback.</p>
            <p>When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would check if the user had an exit click from
              our site for that store on the date mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can be tracked then we will show
              a message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our website to earn cashback prior to the sale.
              All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a
              commission enquiry has been successfully paid by a Retailer, you may receive a lower amount than expected;
              this is due to the amounts received by ourselves possibly being lower than the original claim. We do allow
              you to query this with us. If a Retailer still hasn’t paid a manual commission claim after a period of six
              months then we reserve the right to close the enquiry claim. All payment for Missing Cashback is only applicable
              in instances where the Retailer pays the Company.</p>
            <p>We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where it has been established that any
              credit has been applied in error. This will include but is not limited to transactions where the credit is
              not genuinely due or payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a Retailer or its agencies
              and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions which are already marked as payable or validated in your
              Account, or for transactions which have already been paid over to you by [NEFT or Cheque] or any other means.
              In all such incidences, Kulthas the right to recover all unduly paid cashback which the member is not entitled
              to earn, through legal proceedings.
            </p>
            <p>There are various circumstances in which Cashback will not be payable to the Member, and will be forfeited to
              us, these could be, without limitation:

            </p>
            <p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>Where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a Qualifying Transaction or associated with
                  an Account (such as where the Member is not logged-in to the our site when making the relevant purchase)</li>
                <li>The transaction to which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has been entered into (whether under
                  the right of cancellation that applies to some sales made at a distance, or otherwise) the Cashback is
                  attributed to a Member or Account that has been:
            <p>
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                Suspended by us under Clause 9 of this Agreement or for any other reason;

              </li>
              <li>
                associated with any fraudulent activity or any breach of this Agreement;

            </ol>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <li>
          <h4>Your Account</h4>
          <p>
            You can withdraw your validated cashback when you have at least Rs 250 in your Account. In the event the Member decides to
            close the Account with us or the Member’s Account is closed for any reason whatsoever, before reaching the
            initial Rs 250 limit, there mind be a small transaction fee to withdraw the cashback. Cashback payments by
            Cheque carry an additional fee of Rs 30. This is charged by our Bank to cover administration and postage costs.
            We have the discretion to forfeit any such validated balance showing on your Account for the reasons provided
            elsewhere in this Agreement.

          <h4>Our Role</h4>
          <p>
            We are not a party to any transactions with Retailers, and are not the seller or supplier of any of the goods or services
            that they make available. Thus we do not have any of the legal obligations that apply to the sellers of those
            goods or services.
          </p>
          <p>Accordingly, we have no control over or responsibility for:
          </p>
          <p>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>the quality, safety, or legality of those goods or services available from Retailers; or
            </li>
            <li>
              the quality, safety, or legality of those goods or services available from Retailers; or
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>Members should exercise no lesser degree of caution in entering into transactions with Retailers than they would
            when entering into a similar transaction offline. To the extent that the Applicable Law permits, you release
            us, our agents and employees from all liability arising out of or in connection with any transactions with
            Retailers, including (without limitation) all claims and demands relating to uncompleted or completed transactions
            with Retailers, or goods or services offered for sale or supply, or actually sold or supplied, through or in
            connection with any transactions with Retailers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Misuse</h4>
          <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any Members access to our service, or parts of it, if in our reasonable
            view the relevant Member or Account appears to be in breach of any provision of this Agreement.

          </p>
          <p>Members must not enter into, or attempt to enter into, any transaction with a Retailer or to gain Cashback (a)
            by providing personal information of someone else, or a payment method which they are not entitled to use,
            (b) by deceptively or unfairly exploiting a Retailers offering including but not limited to creating fake or
            unauthorized referral links, or (c) in breach of any terms and conditions applied by us or the Retailer to
            that transaction. We reserve the right to forfeit any pending payments or validated payments in the Member’s
            Account in case of such misuse of our service by the Member.

          </p>
          <p>
            It is each Member’s obligation to ensure that any material posted by him/her or associated with his/her Account:

            Service or misused the Site or the Cashback Service, their Account will be closed, email and IP address will
            be blacklisted so they cannot use it again, and cannot register from the same PC.

            Each Member acknowledges that we are entitled, but not obliged, to withdraw any material, which appears – based on information
            received from third parties or other Members – to be in breach of this Agreement.

          <h4>Operation of our Cashback Service:
          </h4>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to withdraw, modify or suspend aspects of the Cashback Service, or the entirety of it, where we have
            legal, security, technical or commercial reasons to do so. We will endeavor to give you 30 days advance notice
            before taking such action, except where it is necessary to take earlier action for security reasons or because
            of technical difficulties which would otherwise adversely affect the our service. There may also be times when
            the Cashback Service becomes inaccessible as a result of technical difficulties experienced by us or on the
            Internet; we will, however, use reasonable skill and care to overcome these difficulties where they are within
            our control. Please note, however, that we cannot guarantee continuous access to the Cashback Service or any
            of the content that appears on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, we will strive to ensure that any periods of planned unavailability, which you will be informed of when you
            access the Cashback Service at the relevant time, are kept to a minimum.
          </p>
          <p>
            For security or other reasons, we may require you to change password or other information which facilitates access to the
            Cashback Service; however, we will never ask you for your password via email, telephone, or any other means
            other than through the Site. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password
            and any additional identifying information.
